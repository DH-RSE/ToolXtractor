H. Brown, a chemistry professor at Kent State University. The birthplace of
liquid crystal displays (LCD), the LCI is the world's first research center
focused on the

basic and applied science of liquid crystals. The dramatic rise of the liquid
crystal display (LCD) industry

through the subsequent 40 years has fundamentally changed our modern life.

As shown in Figure 1, to research the innovation history of LCI, there are
varieties of data sources in the forms of audio, video, digitalized images,
text from the website, annual reports from 1965-2013, interviews with key
researchers in LCI, booklets from LCI's 50 year anniversary that covers
significant scientists and important events, as well as biennial International
Liquid Crystal Conference (ILCC) materials about the largest academic meeting
in the field of liquid crystals that was started by the LCI founding director
Glenn H. Brown in 1965. At the data processing level, data searching rules
related to the publications, grants, and patents are appointed. For text, text
mining tools, such as Open CALAIS and Cogito Intelligence API, are used to
extract people, locations, and event information from annual reports, booklets
etc. After the initial processing of raw data, data are then imported into
our system, including publications records, grants, patents, inventions,
researchers (such as research staff, post-doctoral fellows, visiting scholars,
etc.), special events, spin-offs, and conferences.

Innovation began taking root as a term associated with science and industry in
the nineteenth century, matching the forward march of the Industrial
Revolution, although the language of that period focused more strongly on the
invention, particularly technical invention (Green, 2013). Nowadays, innovation
is defined simply as a “new idea, device, or method” (Wikipedia). In the Big
Data era, innovation history research not only shows the raw data but also
demonstrates and reveals the deep relationships of data and how the innovation
was generated.

This poster mainly describes an innovation history analysis system, integrating
and visualizing multisource and isomerism data in a static and
dynamic representation manner, considering spatial-temporal factors. A case
study of the Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) at Kent State University is
presented. Liquid Crystal Institute (LCI) was founded in 1965 by Glenn

Figure 1. Structure of LCI innovation system

As argued by Robert E. Williams (Williams, 1987), location can be the critical
link to integrating data from various sources and with various attributes of a
place. Using locations as the key link, any location-related description, from
the formal coordinates of places to the informal abstraction of places, can be
understood by using GIS and various types of Big Data. Thus, the system
geocoded the data which has location information. Besides traditional data
statistics methods, with geo-located data, spatial statistics algorithms can
also be imported to our system to find the spatial correlation of data.

Data visualizations are used to demonstrate the

worldwide impact of LCI related scientists, technologies, and events. Unlike
other tools, such as the “Historical Data Exploration Tool” (Skvrnak and
Mertel, 2016), this system will statically visualize time, space and network
variables, whilst also considering the dynamic network changes in each period.
Furthermore, spatial-temporal analysis algorithms will be imported to display
the spatial and temporal pattern of LCI development. Figure 2 shows
visualization results based on the gathered and processed data. It is developed
by modern web technologies (html5 canvas, javascript, d3 - see Bostock et al,
2011; timeglider). In the center top, there's a timeline integrating important
faculty members, inventions, personal prizes, spin-offs, and other great events
since 1965.

Scientific collaboration is a complex social phenomenon in a search that has
been systematically studied since the 1960s (Noldus and Van Mieghem, 2015). One
of the goals of developing this system is to find out how the LCI can be so
successful in liquid crystal field research and development. From the view
of research collaborations, it may demonstrate the answers. Thus, the system
processes the data related to papers, patents and grants, and visualize the
collaboration networks shown in Fig. 3. On the left of the figure, it
demonstrates the networks, in which each node indicates an author (inventor or
grant recipient) and each link indicates the collaboration. On the right,
it presents the detailed information of researcher when clicking on the node.

This system can be used not only to further relevant historical research but
also to serve as a prototype to demonstrate the potential for linking different
visualization techniques to provide functions facilitating historical data
exploration. Furthermore, it provides collaboration network analysis
environment to dig out new findings in innovation history.
