Introduction

This paper explores the development of the Persons tool (code available on 
Github), an interactive resource for exploring patterns of speeches by
and mentions of characters in dramatic texts. Initially developed to examine
works by Shakespeare, the tool has broad application to dramatic texts.

Visualising the frequency, extent, and position of dialogue relating to a
particular character presents users with a simple and immediate measure of
that character’s prominence within the play. The Persons tool enables users to
select and visualise individual characters’ involvement, producing a novel
means of exploring large-scale structural, narrative, or character-focused
patterns within the text.

The tool is intended to facilitate character-based analysis and reveal
structural patterns at the scale of the play. The tool was conceived with
exploratory potential in mind, and is designed to allow users to customise the
visualisation according to their particular interests or to follow a more
speculative and disinterested reading of the play’s character-based features.

This deliberate aim emerged from the heuristic development process described
below, and a desire to produce an extensible exploratory tool for
dramatic texts. From an initial focus on using digital tools to visualise the
tangling and disentangling of character names and identities in THe ComeDy oF
Errors, our interest broadened into exploring the potential for using character
data to visualise larger structural and narrative patterns.

We were also motivated by the use of network analysis and visualisation for
scholarship on Shakespearean and other literary texts, including work by Yose
et al (2016), Grandjean (2015), Moretti (2011), and Stiller, et al. (2003).
These analyses are similarly character-based and have yielded many interesting
insights. But in the reduction of the textual data to nodes and edges
(characters and their interactions), network analysis has obscured
the temporal. The work of Xanthos, et al. (2016) maintains this temporal
dimension, while exploring the dynamics of the character networks as they
evolve. In contrast, by visualising the characters at the level of the play as
a whole, we aim to preserve characters’ locations within the space of the text,
thereby enabling analysis of the dramatic time and structural duration of the
play.

Tool Development

Tool development took part in two phases. First, the data was extracted and
transformed into a suitable format. The user interface was then designed using
an iterative process that enabled the exploration of various approaches to data
presentation and interaction.

Data Preparation

The tool uses data contained in XML files provided in the New Variorum
Shakespeare editions of THe ComeDy oF Errors and THe Winter's TaLe.

Data was extracted using a custom-developed Python script which iterates
through each play’s XML file extracting character and name data, along with
line number, scene and act identifiers. The data as output as JSON, which
reduces the complexity of using it with the JavaScript-based user interface.

User Interface Design

The tool’s web-based user interface (Figure 1) was developed using the open
source Javascript library, D3 (Bostock et al, 2011). Persons developed from a
fixed and static visualisation of THe ComeDy oF Errors to a more interactive
and exploratory tool. In the heuristic spirit of the tool itself, we describe
here its various iterations, the stages of its development, and the motivations
for various changes to its design and functionality throughout the process.

Expanding the Second Iteration

The second iteration of the tool adopted the circular layout of the tool to
plot character involvement across the entire play, as shown in Figure 3. At
this point, the tool was still static, and its focus on the two pairs of twin
characters in THe ComeDy of Errors represented a desire to deploy visualisation
for a particular exploratory purpose. The play operates on the basis of
identity and confusion, as Antipholus and Dromio of Syracuse are mistaken for
their Ephesian counterparts, and vice versa. Our aim was to plot the speeches
of these four characters to see if the visualisation revealed any insights into
how the identity question was introduced and managed at a structural level.

Persona's focus on character and temporal visualisation is present in the first
iteration of the tool (Figure 2). Speeches and mentions are plotted along
a timeline, with a tabular view switching between the five acts of the play.
All speeches and mentions are colour-coded, resulting in some interesting
patterns and densities at certain parts of the text, but lacking the facility
for isolating chosen characters. In addition, the tabular view of the five acts
lacked the desired holistic view of the entire play.

Figure 3: Second iteration design

Indeed, the visualisation presents several clustered scenes of engagement
between the pairs of twins through which various errors and
misunderstandings are played out. The tell-tale single appearance of Dromio of
Syracuse's orange marker in Act 1, Scene 2 precisely represents the beginnings
of the error and confusion: “What now? How chance thou art returned so soon?”

An additional avenue of exploration in the second iteration of the tool was the
geographical mapping of locations mentioned in the play. THe ComeDy of Errors 
is known for including the only mention of America in Shakespeare's plays,
among several other placenames in its text. In some respects, this
visualisation gives a false impression of THe ComeDy of Errors as a
worldly play. While eighteen locations are mentioned in the text, several of
these are ironically located by Dromio of Syracuse on Nell the kitchen-maid's
body, because “she is sphericall, like a globe: I could find out / Countries in
her” (Act 3, Scene 2).

The final interface

As useful as this view of the play proved, we felt at this point that a more
dynamic and interactive interface was required to allow users to
test hypotheses like our own, or to undertake more exploratory and experimental
visualisations of the data, as illustrated in Figure 4. The circular layout
was retained, as it provided a useful method of presenting the play as a whole,
while maintaining the temporal dimension of the character interactions.
The character-selection menu and the scene-divisions in the outer ring were
thus added in the final stage of development.

Also added were visualisations of higher level metrics to illustrate the number
of times a character speaks, and the number of lines they speak.

Conclusion

A major part of the tool's value is its extensibility. It may be used to create
character visualisations for any play which is XML-encoded according to quite
minimal specifications, and offer the opportunity to undertake comparative
analysis of structural, narrative, and character-based patterns in different
plays. Indeed, while the development of the tool focused on THe ComeDy oF
Errors, a similar visualisation of THe Winter's TaLe (Figure 5) was generated
from New Variorum Shakespeare XML files with no revision to our code.

The trajectory of Persona's development from fixity to interactivity represents
a conclusion that we drew in the course of this project: that a
visualisation tool developed for a particular purpose need not be confined to
its use for that objective alone. The modular and open-source principles of
software development have contributed to a rich and fruitful habit of sharing
within the field of Digital Humanities, and we hope that others will build upon
the tool that we have developed here.

Indeed, we have plans for further developments and improvements to Persons.
Working towards a tool which will enable structural and thematic comparison of
the thirty-six plays in the First Folio, the next phase will test for
structural correlations in a thematic grouping of five additional Shakespearean
plays. This development will strengthen Persona's potential for generating
insights into macro-level structural analysis of dramatic texts, while testing
its technical extensibility by incorporating XML files from another source, THe
BoDLeian First Folio.
