For these reasons, we are pondering the differences between large university DH
and small college DH: a diffuse, decentralized approach to DH versus a
more systematic and integrated one. Our varied papers share several connecting
themes: collaboration across disciplines, roles and institutions; and the
central place of pedagogy. The idea of pedagogy is critical to the mission of
liberal arts colleges, and thus will feature prominently in this discussion. We
place pedagogy at the center of all our work. There is much that larger
institutions can learn from this discussion, including ways to make DH more
student-centered and pedagogically oriented. Without romanticizing
student-centered projects (we will also address some of the challenges for
public scholarship with such a variety of skills at the table) we want to
explore how involving students in the co-production of knowledge -digitally
mediated and publicly presented - shapes and reshapes what is possible under
“DH.”
