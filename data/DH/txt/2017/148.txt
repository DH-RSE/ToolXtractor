Many of the DH approaches to poetry have focused on its metrical aspect
(Birnbaum & Thorsen, 2015a, 2015b; Pue, Teal & Brown, 2015; González-Blanco,
Martínez Cantón & Rio Riande,

2015). Following Chatman & Levin (1967, p. 142) we could say that meter is a
“systematic literary convention whereby certain aspects of the phonology are
organized for aesthetic purposes.” In this sense, versification is an
abstraction of linguistic phenomena in which words (in their formal and
semantical aspect) relate to rhythm and rhyme for artistic purposes. Although
many theories about versification and metrics have been developed for different
languages and traditions, our work is interested in a structural and
formal approach that looks at poetry into discrete units, categories, and their
relationships. Thus, we are involved in analysing how metrical repertoires
in digital form model those structures.

A digital repertoire of poetry metrics is a catalogue that gives account of the
metrical and rhythmical schemes of either a poetical tradition, a period or
school, gathering a corpus of poems that are defined and classified by their
main characteristics. This kind of repertoires may sometimes contain the text
of the poem and information related to authors, manuscripts, editions, music,
and other features, all of them related to the poems. In the beginning,
repertoires were printed books in which we could find information listed in a
way similar to an address book. The digital era has changed the way in
which information is displayed allowing the user to perform complex and
multiple searches. In all these cases there is an ontological leap when the
data is put in digital format.

There are a vast number of European digital

metrical repertoires available online in open access

- e.g. French lyrical collections (Nouveau Naetebus), Italian (BedT), Hungarian
(RPHA), Medieval Latin (Corpus Rhythmorum Musicum, Annalecta Hymnica
Digitalia), Classical Latin (Pedecerto), Galician-portuguese (Oxford
Cantigas de Santa María, MedDB2), Castilian (ReMetCa), Dutch (Dutch Song
Database), Occitan (BedT, Poèsie Neotroubadouresque, The last song of
the Troubadours), Catalan (Repertori d'obres en vers), Skaldic (Skaldic
Project), or German (Lyrik des Minnesänger), among many others. Each one
of these metrical repertoires was developed in a specific technology and stores
data in its own database. This data is locked in the information silos of each
repertoire, not available freely to be compared and used by intelligent
machines that could infer over the data. The lack of interoperability between
the different digital repertoires dealing with poetry across
different languages, literatures and traditions is a problem that needs to be
addressed (González-Blanco & Seláf, 2014; González-Blanco, Rio Riande,
Martínez Cantón & Martos Pérez, 2014; González-Blanco, E. G., Rio Riande, G.del
& Martínez Cantón, C., 2016a). There is an interoperability problem since
the technological solutions used for building the database of each digital
repertoire employ a different data model.

POSTDATA is a project funded by a Starting Grant of the European Research
Council whose main goal is to study European poetry in a comparative and wide
context. Its starting point is the analysis of digital metrical repertoires as
digital objects that have been developed to expose European poetry on the Web
of Documents in open access. POSTDATA is an idea that resulted from previous
work developed by a network of partners that own digital metrical repertoires
and that have been working together for some years.

The POSTDATA project focuses mainly on the possibilities of Linked Open Data
(LOD) technologies in order to publish the data available on information silos
in the Web of Data as LOD. A side effect of this project is that not only
this network will be able to publish its own data in LOD but also any other
entity that owns data related to poetic metrics. Once the data is structured
the same way and published in the Web of Data, anyone will be able to deploy
new software that uses this data. It will be possible to compare, extrapolate
and create new views of the data, opening doors to new knowledge in i) literary
research communities since POSTDATA results will enable comparisons of poetic
traditions and the creation of new repertoires, and ii) literature
learning environments for e.g. the development of editorial projects following
the common conceptual model.

LOD technologies are very powerful since one can implement intelligent agents
to infer over the data (W3C, 2010). Another advantage of LOD over other
paradigms is the infinite possibilities of linking data, allowing agents to
rely also on other sources of information to build knowledge.

The first step of POSTDATA is the development of a Metadata Application Profile
(MAP) for the community of practice of Digital Humanities that deal with
poetry. An MAP is a semantic model, a construct that enhances interoperability
(Nilsson, Baker, & Johnston, 2008).

The development of an MAP is a crucial task for

any community of practice. This development

should be structured, and has to integrate -since the early phases of
development- elements of representative members of the community. Commonly the
organizations of a community of practice differ in organization-type,
location, culture and in the language they speak. In poetry studies, all these
are key factors, since metrics and their features are based largely on the
nature of the languages. In addition, in the case of the Digital Humanities
Poetry metrics community, the way metrics has been conceptualised in the
different traditions is however diverse, as there are multiple ways of encoding
and understanding metrical systems. Finding a common ground of understanding in
such an environment becomes a huge challenge. These digital metrical
repertoires are the key to build an inclusive MAP for poetry, since they
reflect different approaches of conceptualising poetry and their formal
features. POSTDATA is using Me4MAP, a method for the development of metadata
application profiles (see Curado Malta & Baptista 2013a, 2013b), to develop the
referred MAP. According to Me4MAP, the first activities in such a development
are “S1 -Developing the Functional Requirements” and “S2 -Developing the Domain
Model,” these two activities result, respectively, in the Functional
Requirements deliverable and in the Domain Model deliverable. S1 activity feeds
S2 activity.

A Domain Model is a conceptual model that is used to explicit the concepts that
exist in a certain universe of discourse. The concepts have properties to show
how they are defined and related.

As described in Curado Malta, Centenera & Gonzalez-Blanco (2017), the work-team
is developing the Domain Model at the same time S1 activities occur, slightly
changing the order of S1 and S2. This change is possible since Me4MAP is also
under evaluation and testing in a Design Science Research methodological
approach -for more information about this process see Curado Malta (2014). This
Me4MAP testing is leaded by one of the authors.

The goal of this paper is to present a preliminary version of the Domain Model
of the MAP for Poetry - Domain Model V0.1. The following paragraphs give
details on how this version of the Domain Model was developed.

The Domain model V0.1 was developed based on the analysis of eleven data models
of databases of metrical repertoires (see Table 1) using a reverse engineering
technique -for more details about this technique see Curado Malta et al.
(2017).

Table 1. Repertoires which databases were used as basis for Domain Model V0.1

These repertoires have different technologies and paradigms: ten are in the Web
of Documents and one is deployed locally. The technologies in which the
databases are implemented are: 1) MySQL databases, 2) XML databases and files,
3) Perl scripts and, 4) Worksheet files.

The Domain Model of the MAP is represented as an Unified Modeling Language
(UML) class diagram that expresses POSTDATA proposal for a common conceptual
model for the European Poetry. The Domain Model V0.1 is available at the
permanent link https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.437827. The technique used to
represent the domain model is UML since it is a standard technique (ISO/
IEC 19505-1 and 19505-2) to model businesses and processes very well known in
the software engineering community -see Rumbaugh, Jacobson and Booch (2004).

This first version will be tested in a Workshop held in March where partners of
the project will follow a hands-on session to test the Domain Model V0.1 using
a resource of its own database. POSTDATA will give to each partner a template
testing sheet and information about the mapping between the database in
question and the Domain Model. The conclusions of the testing and of other
workshop discussions will feed the process of development of the Domain Model.
The work-team programs to deliver a version 0.2 out of this
worshop conclusions. This process of development is highly iterative; it will
be fed by the following activities:

• development of S1 activities (as already referred before);

•    Analysis of the results of a survey to final users: POSTDATA wants to know
the needs of final users of repertoires in order to understand their problems
and how they can be solved. Part of the survey is created based on the existent
models. The survey also has open questions for users to fill in freely.

•    Analysis of other poetic repertoires: there are still at least eleven
databases' data models to be analysed. POSTDATA is still looking for more
poetic repertoires in order to have a wider representation of other languages
and traditions (plewease see the geographical view of the repertoires) Analysis
of the information of two case studies: two researchers are building a digital
repertoire at the same time the MAP is being developed; they will inform the
work-team about their needs.

Once a stable version of the Domain Model is available, POSTDATA will follow
the activities described by Me4MAP. One important activity is the mapping of
the Domain Model to a semantic model, where every property of the Domain Model
will be matched by a RDF vocabulary term, other constraints such as
cardinality, domain and range must also be defined. In order to
enhance interoperability, this matching has to be done taing care that the most
popular vocabularies of the LOD ecosystem are used. A study of the most
used vocabularies will be performed so as to find the best options for each
term. Examples of RDF vocabularies that might be used are Dublin Core Metadata
Terms, Digitised Manuscripts to Europeana (DM2E), Friend of a Friend (FOAF)
 vocabularies, among others. This semantic model will be tested in an iterative
process of development, using resources from metrical repertoires that were not
used as cases in the metadata application profile process development.
