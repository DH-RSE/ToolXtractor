In most Western cultural contexts, the surgical modification of the female
breast is usually presumed to take place in the context of cosmetic surgery
primarily aimed at breast enhancement for the cis-gendered female. The cultural
obsession with sexualizing breasts as a signifier of both heterosexuality
and femininity has meant gender trouble for breast cancer patients (and BRCA
“previvors”) seeking flat mastectomies, as well as transmasculine, genderqueer,
and FTM individuals electing top surgeries. Whereas trans studies critiques
have traced the emergence of (and subsequent resistance to) a prescriptive
medical narrative authorizing gender affirming top surgeries, only recently
have some in the breast cancer community begun to form identity groups around
non-reconstructive surgical choices and an embrace of “flatness” on social
media. This presentation is a comparative study of the reported experiences and
rhetorical choices of social networks of two flat mastectomy groups:
those pursuing mastectomy for reasons of gender affirmation, and those for whom
mastectomy is primarily a treatment for cancer or cancer risk. The emergence
of the Flattopper Pride movement within the breast cancer community represents
a queering of conventional (female) breast reconstruction, offering feminist
rhetoric that resists presumptions about the “natural” embodiment of femininity
while occupying a position that is at once informed by transgender surgical
narratives (and counter-narratives) yet articulates a distinctly different
relationship to surgical modification of the female body. The circulation of
mastectomy images through trans, queer fashion (Cat Walk & Play Out underwear
models), and e-patient breast cancer communities represents three distinct yet
overlapping discursive contexts in which mastectomy derives cultural meaning.
Through an exploration of how mastectomy images are circulated, censored, and
shared in a variety of social media networks and support groups, feminist and
queer critiques of surgical mastectomy options can be seen to emerge and create
cross-influence between breast cancer, transgender, and
genderqueer communities.
